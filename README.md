## Details

### Deliverables

* A repo containing at least:
  * `dist/index.html`
  * `dist/images/background.png`
  * `dist/css/style.css`

### Requirements

* No real W3C validation errors
* The fourth breakpoint should have a fixed with of 980px for the main content.


## Normal Mode
Using the breakpoint images below, create the the website using HTML and CSS. For each breakpoint, starting with the first, you *must* have at least one commit of your work. Starting with the mobile breakpoint first will save you a lot of headaches and is manditory for this assignment. All files should be saved in a dist directory in the root of your repository.

1. [Breakpoint 1](/breakpoint1.png) - 0 to 478px
2. [Breakpoint 2](/breakpoint2.png) - 479px to 767px
3. [Breakpoint 3](/breakpoint3.png) - 767px to 978px
4. [Breakpoint 4](/breakpoint4.png) - 979px and larger


## Notes

For the first three breakpoints, the content (pricing boxes and paragraphs) should stretch to fit the width of the page as it scales. For the fourth breakpoint, the content should max out at 980px and not grow larger than that. Instead it should stay centered on the page.
