# Responsive Site

## Description
This assignment will walk you through creating a fully responsive website from start to finish.


## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you shouldâ€¦

* Understand how to implement a responsive website
* Have experience searching for answers on Google, StackOverflow and MDN.


### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you be able to effectively use

* CSS media queries
* Advanced CSS properties

## Details

### Deliverables

* A repo containing at least:
  * `index.html`
  * `images/background.png`
  * `styles/main.scss`
  * `sketches/breakpoint1.jpg`
  * `sketches/breakpoint2.jpg`
  * `sketches/breakpoint3.jpg`
  * `sketches/breakpoint4.jpg`

### Requirements

* The fourth breakpoint should have a fixed with of 980px for the main content.
* You must use [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) for cross browser consistency.


## Normal Mode
Using the breakpoint images below, create the the website using HTML and CSS. For each breakpoint, starting with the first, you will do the following:

1. Sketch out how the layout for that breakpoint will look. Upload that picture to your computer and put it in a folder called `sketches` within your github repository.
1. Add, commit and push your picture.
1. Write the HTML and CSS for your layout in an `index.html` file and `styles/main.scss` file. You must use sass for your CSS along with the sass command to compile it to css.
1. Add, commit and push your code.

### Breakpoints

1. [Breakpoint 1](/breakpoint1.png) - 0 to 478px
2. [Breakpoint 2](/breakpoint2.png) - 479px to 767px
3. [Breakpoint 3](/breakpoint3.png) - 767px to 978px
4. [Breakpoint 4](/breakpoint4.png) - 979px and larger

The image used on this website [can be found here](/background.jpg).

## Hard Mode

Using the breakpoint images below, create the the website using HTML and CSS. Try to re-use as much CSS as you can from the normal mode to make your life easier. Look for opportunities to to Sass variables, nesting, imports and mixins.

### Breakpoints

1. [Breakpoint 1](/contact-breakpoint1.png) - 0 to 478px
2. [Breakpoint 2](/contact-breakpoint2.png) - 767px to 978px
3. [Breakpoint 3](/contact-breakpoint3.png) - 979px and larger

## Notes

For the first three breakpoints, the content (pricing boxes and paragraphs) should stretch to fit the width of the page as it scales. For the fourth breakpoint, the content should max out at 980px and not grow larger than that. Instead it should stay centered on the page.

I recommend that you glance over all of the breakpoints before you write any code to get a feel for how the different elements move around. Structure your HTML in a way that will make it easy to make these adjustments **only using css**. We can't modify our HTML based on page width, only our CSS, so your HTML needs to remain consistent no-matter what the width of the page is.
